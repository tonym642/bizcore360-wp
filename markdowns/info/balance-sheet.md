# Balance Sheet Module – Information

The **Balance Sheet module** provides a snapshot of your business’s financial position at any given moment.  
It helps you understand what you own, what you owe, and what’s left over — your net worth.

### Key Components
- **Assets:** Everything the company owns — cash, inventory, equipment, and receivables.  
- **Liabilities:** Debts and obligations, including loans and accounts payable.  
- **Equity:** The owner’s residual interest after liabilities are subtracted from assets.

### Why It Matters
Your balance sheet reveals the overall health and stability of your organization.  
It’s the foundation for financial ratios used in lending, valuation, and growth analysis.  
This module makes those numbers simple to interpret and update.
