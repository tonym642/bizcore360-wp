# Budget Module – Best Practices

These guidelines help you get the most out of your budgeting process inside BizCore360.

### 1. Review and Adjust Monthly
Schedule a monthly budget review to compare actual vs. projected performance.  
Small recurring adjustments are more effective than large, reactive corrections.

### 2. Categorize Expenses Clearly
Maintain consistent categories for operating, marketing, payroll, and growth expenses.  
This ensures you can compare data accurately across quarters and years.

### 3. Use Historical Data for Forecasting
Study your past 6–12 months of financial activity before finalizing a new budget.  
Patterns in revenue or expense trends are powerful forecasting tools.

### 4. Maintain a Profit Threshold
Aim to maintain a minimum profit margin of **20%** after all costs.  
If your ratio drops below this, reevaluate fixed costs and resource allocation.

### 5. Reinvest Strategically
Set aside a fixed percentage of your profits for innovation, team development, or automation.  
Consistent reinvestment builds long-term scalability and resilience.

When applied consistently, these practices turn your budget from a static spreadsheet into a living management tool — one that helps your business grow intentionally and sustainably.
