# Balance Sheet Module – Best Practices

A strong balance sheet reflects long-term financial health.  
Follow these practices to maintain clarity and stability.

### 1. Reconcile Monthly
Compare your balance sheet with bank and loan statements monthly to ensure accuracy.  
Small discrepancies compound quickly if ignored.

### 2. Classify Assets Correctly
Separate short-term assets (cash, receivables) from long-term ones (property, equipment).  
This distinction is essential for liquidity and ratio analysis.

### 3. Manage Liabilities Proactively
Track maturity dates for loans and obligations.  
Renegotiate or refinance debt before it becomes a strain on working capital.

### 4. Monitor Equity Trends
If equity is declining over time, investigate whether losses, withdrawals, or asset depreciation are responsible.  
Equity is your company’s health score.

### 5. Use It for Strategy
The balance sheet isn’t just accounting — it’s insight.  
Use it to assess your leverage, liquidity, and ability to expand.
