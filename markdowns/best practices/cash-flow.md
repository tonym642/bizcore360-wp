# Cash Flow Module – Best Practices

These practices help ensure consistent liquidity and sustainable operations.

### 1. Forecast Ahead
Plan cash inflows and outflows at least 3 months in advance.  
Anticipate slow seasons and allocate reserves accordingly.

### 2. Monitor Weekly
Even small timing gaps between payments and receivables can strain your finances.  
Check your cash position weekly to prevent overdrafts or late fees.

### 3. Separate Funds
Keep business reserves, payroll, and tax funds in separate accounts.  
This simplifies forecasting and minimizes the risk of misallocation.

### 4. Delay Non-Essential Spending
Postpone non-critical expenses until after major inflows.  
Cash management is about timing — not just totals.

### 5. Leverage Surpluses
When you have excess cash, consider short-term investment vehicles or pay down high-interest debt.
